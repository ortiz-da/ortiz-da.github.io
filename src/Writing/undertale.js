            <h1>Using Undertale to Teach in Schools</h1>
            <h4>29 September 2019</h4>
            <p>As the world moves into a digital age, it gains more and more technological resources to use in improving
                lives. Many times these resources are used for entertainment, communication, or work. Unfortunately, the
                field of education has been slow to fully utilize the power of digital media. One on one iPad programs,
                course websites, or YouTube video lectures can all be used to smooth out the teaching process. However,
                these resources are, for the most part, simply being used as slicker, faster ways to carry out
                pre-existing teaching methods. One way for educators to effectively utilize the teaching potential of
                digital media would be through pre-existing, popular, and well received video games. The game Undertale
                by Toby Fox is one such game. Released in 2015, Undertale is a story-based role playing game with 8-bit,
                pixelated graphics. It has sold over 3.5 million copies1 and touched the lives of many with its quirky
                characters and branching storyline. Thanks to its fun nature and many different possible playstyles,
                Undertale has the ability to spark discussions that have room for many different perspectives. Undertale
                should be used in schools as a relatable medium to teach students media literacy, experimentation,
                understanding of other’s differences, and the consequences of decisions.</p>

            <p>Currently, many schools’ curriculums are primarily book based. Although an incredibly important aspect of
                learning, books are not the only form of media that can communicate information. Using Undertale to
                teach in the classroom would help familiarize students with the growing digital world that they live in.
                Anna J. Small Roseboro, holder of a BA in speech communications and an MA in curriculum design,2
                declares, “Being observant professionals, we must admit that current society is less likely to turn to
                books for information and less likely to use a pen and paper to communicate ideas. We, therefore, must
                teach our students media literacy, to help them become critical of information presented in a variety of
                formats and to become efficient users of communication technology as well.” 3 The ability of video games
                to teach media literacy is too valuable to ignore. Simply focusing on being fluent in one form of media
                is not enough. It is important to be able to understand information coming from a variety of different
                sources, including that of games.</p>

            <p>Undertale would help captivate students in the learning process because it is an immersive form of media
                that is familiar to young audiences. According to a study done by Amanda Lenhart on 1060 teenagers, 72%
                of them played video games.4 Clearly, many students are playing video games in their free time, meaning
                that they already have some sort of familiarity with games. It would be foolish to not utilize such a
                powerful teaching tool. A paper titled Meeting Students Where They Are, which was used at the National
                Summit on K-12 Competency-Based Education, accurately explains, “Meeting all students where they are is
                a commitment that requires that we reconfigure our old systems and practices and paradigms; that we
                place the individual learner at the center of the learning process; and that the learning process - what
                actually happens cognitively, neurologically, and developmentally as children learn - be placed at the
                center of the pedagogical model.” 5 The uphill battle of trying to make education fun takes time and
                effort that could be otherwise used to improve curriculums, or engage in more open discussions. When
                teachers work the other way around, making fun educational, they begin to cooperate with, instead of
                push against, the preferences of students.</p>

            <p>What makes video games fun is their potential to be explored. Some games have solid, defined rules that
                the player is held by in order to create consistency. However, Undertale breaks the mold in this area
                with its unexpected weirdness and openness to new playstyles. It looks into the concept to the extremes,
                both darkly and humorously. “What happens if I seek absolute power, disregarding the side effects it
                entails? Can I befriend this monster instead of killing it? What if I just keep petting this dog for
                five minutes?” Undertale allows players to try all of these things, and much more, accounting for even
                the wildest of questions. This interconnected world requires players to learn about the relationship
                between their character, and each of the personalities they meet along their quest. Without this
                knowledge, it may be difficult to understand why other characters act the way they do.</p>

            <p>This sort of teaching can definitely be useful, as proven by the use of narrative pedagogy in the nursing
                field. “It’s storytelling, to teach complex clinical topics” Lippincott Nursing Education Blog explains,
                “Learners consider the emotional experiences of participants, challenging conventional wisdom and
                otherwise constructing their new understandings and perspectives” 6 This approach is valuable because it
                takes into account not just how to carry out a task, but also, the possible consequences of carrying out
                such a task in a living, breathing world. Rarely are problems two dimensional, with a single reason for
                distress, and a single “correct” answer. Therefore, the ability to analyze a situation and come up with
                multiple different plans of attack is incredibly valuable to a work environment with dozens of
                influential variables. In his 2008 article Toward a narrative pedagogy for interactive learning
                environments, Paul Hazel argues, “all meaning is ultimately socially situated. Whatever the facts,
                meaning – the sense or evaluation of those facts – must always be contextualized. There must always
                exist a dialogue between the facts ‘‘out there’’ and the sense made of them ‘‘in here.’’ Narrative,
                then, is a vehicle for the expression of this negotiation” 7 Real discussions can only occur when
                multiple sides of a topic are explored. In order to prepare students for a realistic world, teachers
                must account for these multiple sides, allowing for open discussion to help students better understand
                topics.</p>

            <p>Undertale can spark open discussions because it rewards exploration, providing incentive to follow one’s
                own ideas as opposed to those of others. Due to this design aspect, a base, shared experience becomes a
                truly interesting conversation topic thanks to slight variations in gameplay choices. This alleviates
                the common complaint of “Why are we learning this, it has nothing to do with me?” that students have had
                for years. Kelly Mathew, a Doctor of Philosophy in English who graduated from the University of
                Pittsburgh, explains in his dissertation titled Now You're Playing With Pedagogy: Video Games, Digital
                Literacies, and Trans-Media Participatory Cultures “The multimodal nature of video games can lead
                students into larger discussions regarding the role of textual reception or analysis as these concepts
                function in other media, be they digital or otherwise.” 8 The many immersive aspects of Undertale,
                especially its writing, all work together to create a colorful and enjoyable experience for students to
                discuss.</p>

            <p>While it is impossible for a game to capture all students’ interests and attention equally well, the room
                for variation in playstyle that is present in Undertale helps to personally tailor discussions,
                arguments, and learning experiences for students of many different backgrounds. Specifically, Undertale
                contains many diverse characters, ones that are humorous, clueless, caring, tragic, mentally troubled,
                and more. This creates multiple points of possible connection with students, even if they don’t consider
                themselves serious “gamers”. If students can relate to the game being used to teach, they will feel more
                inclined to participate in discussions, sharing their similar, though personalized experience of the
                game.</p>

            <p>Despite its pixelated, cartoony appearance, Undertale brings up many diverse questions about
                communication, and misunderstanding. In an increasingly globalized world, intercultural communication is
                a vital skill for success in any field. Diversity in the classroom is definitely a possibility, but if
                it’s not present, it can’t be forced. Undertale is a story that is heavily driven by the interactions of
                diverse characters. It places the player in the middle of a world full of colorful monsters and animals.
                Which of these inhabitants the player develops understanding and deeper friendships with is up to
                individual preference. It is totally possible to play through Undertale without really knowing the
                backstory or motives of a character. But when examined more deeply, each of the prominent monsters and
                animals all have interesting lives that offer new ways of looking at the world. This lesson can be
                applied back into the real world as well. Nobody should be judged at face value, stereotypes are
                dangerous, and every individual has something unique to offer. In all aspects of life: work, home,
                relationships with family and friends, these ideas are invaluable to effective understanding and
                communicating with others.</p>

            <p>The essential ability to understand the consequences of decisions is a skill that Undertale teaches in a
                unique way. Normally, this intelligence of cause and effect can only really be learned through hands on
                experience. Telling a child that throwing a tantrum will not get him what he wants is one thing. Showing
                him is another. However, as young adults mature and move onto more complex social relationships, it is
                not always easy to provide real life examples of consequences without actually carrying out a dangerous
                and/or harmful event. This is where Undertale excels. Its digital scenarios allow for players to decide
                how the story progresses, and see how their choices affect the world around them. While studying movies,
                books, or historical events can show us the results of other’s decisions, Undertale directly provides
                reactions to the player’s own choices in a contained environment. This way of telling a story powerfully
                illustrates how seemingly trivial actions of the past can lead to wonderful friendships, or vicious
                enemies. Such levels of interactivity are simply not present in other forms of media.
            </p>

            <p>Not all video games could serve as appropriate teaching tools in the classroom. Many games are simply
                meant to entertain and nothing more. It is justifiable to be opposed to incorporating such games into
                school curricula. In order for video games to be used as effective teaching tools, the games chosen
                should have content that is both suitable to analyse, and sufficiently deep in complexity. Similar to
                how novels are reviewed before being used in an English literature class, games would also have to be
                thoroughly examined ahead of time to determine their appropriateness.</p>

            <p>Video games have evolved very quickly over a short period of time. They are now fully capable of sharing
                stories, worlds, and characters with people in ways never before possible. This powerful new technology
                can expose players to abstract ideas or difficult situations in order to teach important lessons.
                Schools would benefit greatly from using Undertale to teach such concepts. Not only can this game engage
                students more than other forms of traditional media, it also encourages exploration, and looking at the
                world from the eyes of others. Discussion of one’s experience of Undertale comes naturally, and is both
                personal and relevant to each individual player. Taking advantage of these strengths would help teach
                abstract social concepts to students, better preparing them to be a part of a digitally connected
                world.</p>
